# ApartmentWebAutomationDemo
Demo web automation on Apartments.com
Open "ApartmentsWebAutomation.sln" solution file by your latest Visual Studio IDE. Rebuild the project if needed. Open Test Explorer from Test/Window/Test Explorer menu. Run "SignInUnsuccessfulTest" test case. Observe the results from Chrome browser as well as Test Explorer. You may run a couple of times if you like. My testing time for this test case is about 5 seconds. 
I built this simple and quick testing framework just for the demo. In the real world I would like to build more sophisticated testing framework with better structure and more driver nodes and layers, maybe with client-server architecture.
I like to write self-documenting “clear code” as Uncle Bob advocates but this time I still put some comments for whoever reviews the code. It should be very easy to read and understand my code like plain English that is what I try to accomplish. So, please review the code and let me know if you have any question, comment or suggestion.
Thanks,
Ping
