# ApartmentWebAutomationDemo
Demo automation on Apartments.com
Clone the project and then open "ApartmentsWebAutomation.sln" solution file by your latest Visual Studio IDE. Rebuild the project if needed. Open Test Explorer from Test/Window/Test Explorer menu or from the side bar. Run "SignInUnsuccessfulTest" test case. Observe the results from Chrome browser as well as Test Explorer. You may run twice if you think it is slow for the first run. My testing time for this test case is about 5 seconds. 
I built this simple and quick testing framework just for the demo. In the real world I would like to build more sophisticated testing framework with better structure and more driver/nodes and layers and with client-server architecture.
I like to write self-documenting “clear code” as Uncle Bob advocates but this time I still put some comments for whoever reviews the code. It should be very easy to read and understand my code here like plain English that is what I try to accomplish. So, please review the code and let me know if you have any question, comment or suggestion.
Thanks,
Ping
